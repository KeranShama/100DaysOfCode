# Caesar Cipher Encryption Program

## Overview

This is a simple Caesar cipher encryption and decryption program written in C++. The Caesar cipher is one of the oldest and simplest methods of encryption. This program allows you to encrypt and decrypt text by shifting characters in the text by a specified number of positions in the alphabet.

## Features

- **Encryption and Decryption**: Encrypts and decrypts text using the Caesar cipher technique.
- **Custom Shift Values**: Allows any integer shift value, including negative values, and handles shifts larger than 26.
- **Case Sensitivity**: Maintains the case of letters during encryption and decryption.
- **Space Handling**: Preserves spaces and non-alphabetic characters, keeping them unchanged.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Command-line interface for inputting text, choosing shift values, and selecting encryption or decryption.
