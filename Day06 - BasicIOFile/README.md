# Basic File I/O Project in Java

This project is part of my #100DaysOfCode challenge where I developed a Java program for Basic File Input/Output operations.

## Project Description

The program performs the following tasks:
- Reads data from `doc1.txt`.
- Processes the data to count words and copy it to `doc2.txt`.
- Implements error handling for file operations.
