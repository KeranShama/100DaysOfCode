# Fibonacci Series Generator in C++

This project is part of my #100DaysOfCode challenge, where I developed a Fibonacci Series Generator in C++.

## Overview

The Fibonacci Series Generator allows users to input a number and generate the Fibonacci series up to that number of terms. It includes a simple console-based user interface for input and output.

## Features

- **User Interface**: Console-based UI for easy interaction.
- **Functionality**: Generates Fibonacci series up to a specified number of terms.
- **Error Handling**: Validates input and dismisses invalid numbers gracefully.
- **Interactive**: Offers options to continue generating series or exit based on user input.
