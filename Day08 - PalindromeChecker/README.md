ðŸš€ **Day 8 of #100DaysOfCode Challenge** ðŸš€

ðŸŽ‰ I'm excited to share that I've successfully completed Day 8 of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Today, I built a **Palindrome Checker** program in Java!

## Features
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple console-based UI to interact with the user.
- **String Input**: Accepts a string input from the user.
- **Palindrome Check**: Cleans the string by removing non-alphanumeric characters and converts it to lowercase for accurate comparison.
- **Ignores Symbols and Spaces**: Efficiently processes the input by ignoring symbols and spaces before checking.
- **Result Display**: Informs the user if the input string is a palindrome or not.
- **Continue/Exit Option**: Allows the user to check multiple strings in one session or exit the program.

## Key Learnings
- Enhanced my skills in string manipulation and user input handling in Java.
- Improved understanding of loops and conditionals for creating interactive programs.
