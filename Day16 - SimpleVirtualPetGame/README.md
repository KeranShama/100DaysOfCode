# Simple Virtual Pet Game

Welcome to the **Simple Virtual Pet Game**! This is a console-based Java application where you can interact with a virtual pet by feeding, playing, and resting it. This project is part of my 100DaysOfCode challenge.

## Features

- **Feed**: Decrease your pet's hunger level and increase its energy.
- **Play**: Boost your pet's happiness and decrease its energy.
- **Rest**: Restore your pet's energy and slightly improve its hunger level.
- **Quit**: Exit the game at any time.
- **Game-over Conditions**: The game ends if the pet's happiness or energy drops too low or if happiness exceeds a certain threshold.
