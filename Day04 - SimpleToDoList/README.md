# Command-line To-Do List Application in Java

This is a simple command-line to-do list application implemented in Java as part of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. The application allows users to manage their tasks efficiently with basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Easily add new tasks to your to-do list.
- **Remove Tasks**: Remove tasks either one by one or clear the entire list.
- **Edit Tasks**: Edit existing tasks to keep your list up-to-date.
- **View Tasks**: See all your tasks displayed clearly in the console.
- **Loop Until Quit**: Continuously prompts the user until they choose to exit, ensuring seamless task management.
- **Cross-platform**: Works seamlessly on Windows and Unix-based systems.
- **Error Handling**: Includes robust error handling to ensure smooth user interactions.
- **Data Persistence**: Implements data persistence to save tasks between sessions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive commands ('a' for add, 'r' for remove, 'e' for edit) make task management straightforward.
